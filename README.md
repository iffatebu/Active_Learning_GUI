# Fish Annotation Review Tool (GUI)
<div align="justify">
This tool is designed to assist users in reviewing annotations of fish images that were developed using machine learning algorithms. The tool displays detailed information such as bounding box coordinates, class labels, confidence scores, and track IDs. The tool can be executed on a desktop or a laptop. It can upload CSV files generated by programs such as Video and Image Analytics for Marine Environments (VIAME) [the link of VIAME- https://www.viametoolkit.org/]. The tool allows the user to manage and update several features of annotation.

# Purpose of the GUI
<div align="justify">
Detecting and classifying fish underwater can be challenging, even with the use of advanced models. Inaccuracies in annotation can significantly affect habitat analysis and evaluation. To enhance model accuracy, it is essential to meticulously review and correct annotations. The Fish Annotation Review Tool serves this purpose by allowing users to efficiently and accurately review annotations for fish in various images. It is specifically designed to support the Active Learning model, as such models require human intervention to provide feedback during the training process. Clone this repository:

# Project Structure

- **CODE/**: Contains the main code file [labelImg_NGI_MainCode.py](https://github.com/MattGrossi-NOAA/FATES-ATI-ActiveLearningGUI/blob/main/CODE/labelImg_NGI_MainCode.py) for running the GUI, as well as the [predefined_classes.txt](https://github.com/MattGrossi-NOAA/FATES-ATI-ActiveLearningGUI/blob/main/CODE/predefined_classes.txt) file, which holds class labels. Class labels can be added or removed from this .txt file.
- **Dataset/**: This folder includes a sample CSV file, [Demo_dataset.csv](https://github.com/MattGrossi-NOAA/FATES-ATI-ActiveLearningGUI/blob/main/Dataset/Demo_dataset.csv), along with related images (.png) and annotation files (.xml) needed to run the project.
- **Manual of Fish Annotation Review Tool-V2.0.pdf**: A comprehensive user manual, [Manual of Fish Annotation Review Tool-V2.0.pdf file](https://github.com/MattGrossi-NOAA/FATES-ATI-ActiveLearningGUI/blob/main/Manual%20of%20Fish%20Annotation%20Review%20Tool-V2.0.pdf), detailing project features and instructions on how to use the tool.
- **README.md**: The main README file with some important details about project.
